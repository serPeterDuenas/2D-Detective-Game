  itemDescription: 'A watch. I found it inside of the lockers alongside an unfinished
    poem addressed to Bianca. Detective Miguel wears the exact same watch, as this
    one, and it''s honestly not very expensive. Even I could buy something tacky
    like this...


    This could possibly be a motivation behind Mr. Cruz''s murder.'
